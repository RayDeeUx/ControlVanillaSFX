# ControlVanillaSFX

Control the volume of SFX from vanilla GD separately from the volume of SFX from a level's SFX triggers.

To change the volume of vanilla SFX, please open this mod's custom settings.

If you're particularly lazy, you can view the video demo on this mod's GitHub repository (find the octocat logo towards the bottom right).

<cr>To repeat: In order to change the volume of vanilla GD's sound effects, open this mod's custom settings.</c>
